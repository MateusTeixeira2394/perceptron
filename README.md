# perceptron
Perceptron is an artificial neural network. It is a linearly separate classifier. In this project, I implemented Perceptron with javascript, html and css. Also, I used framework materializecss.

When you open the Perceptron page, you will find an empty text box. In it you will paste the text of a CSV. After this step, import the text into the project. Then, click on "Treinar" to Coaching. When training the neural network, you will find a table showing the step-by-step how the neural network was trained. Just below, there is another empty text box. In it, you will paste another CSV to test the neural network, to see if it actually hit.
